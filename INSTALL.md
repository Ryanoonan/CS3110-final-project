# Installation Guidelines

Make sure you have Ocaml installed, if not this link 
(https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/preface/install.html) can help you 
out. <br>
We need to install a package and to do that run - <br>
opam update <br>
opam upgrade <br>
opam install ANSITerminal <br>

Once you have installed OCaml, the required packages, and downloaded the project 
files - <br>
1) In your terminal cd to the folder that contains the project files. <br>
2) Type make play and hit enter <br>
3) After it loads you are now in the game!
